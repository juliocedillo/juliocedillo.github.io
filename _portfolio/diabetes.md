title: "Not So Sweet: Expanded Social Stress in New Diabetics"
excerpt: "Type 2 diabetes is a chronic illness that significantly disrupts an individualâ€™s prior lifestyle. New adaptions must be considered to maintain a healthy status that includes diet, physical exercise, and mental health. This study explores the newly introduced hardships that follow diabetics and emphasizes both the biomedical and psychosocial challenges they endure. Highlighting the complex intersection of financial, social, and cultural burdens that exacerbate the stress of living with diabetes, diabetics are under immense social pressure to assimilate into a new profound medical lifestyle. This study looks at how type 2 diabetics support strategies in managing their chronic illness."
