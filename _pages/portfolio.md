## [The Return of the Real Economy](https://juliocedillo.github.io/neweconomy)
### Undergraduate Research Lead | Principal Investigator: Armando Lara-Millán, Ph.D.
I'm currently working under Professor Lara-Millán in the Faculty-Mentored Undergraduate Research Fellowship offered by the Latinx Research Center. I'm leading two fellow undergraduates in the data-cleaning process and curating a database on economic actors. 

## [Going Rogue: The Military and the Rise of the Right Latino](https://juliocedillo.github.io/military)
### Undergraduate Research Fellow | Advisor: Michael Rodríguez-Muñiz, Ph.D.
My ongoing thesis project was made possible by the Haas Scholars Program. I am researching the effect of military service on Latino identity, political engagement, and citizenship among Latino soldiers. I coded this website for interested participants for information on the procedure.
