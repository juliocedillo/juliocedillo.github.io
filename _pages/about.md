Julio Cedillo is a BA candidate in Sociology at the University of California, Berkeley. His research investigates how political identity is shaped through military service among Latinos, exploring how martial citizenship leads to belonging in the United States among minorities.

Before beginning his BA, Julio earned an AA-T in Sociology and an AA in Chicana/o Studies from San Diego City College. Beyond his academic pursuits, Julio is an active participant in facilitating academic transitions among California community college students at UC Berkeley. He revived the long inactive Latinx Sociological Association with other students, and now provides fellowship among Latinx sociology students and explores issues in the field of sociology.
