I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student in the Department of Sociology at the University of California, Berkeley advised by Michael Rodríguez-Muñiz. My research focuses on Latinos and legal consciousness through militarization, conservative voter engagement, and the politics of recognition.

I am supported by the Miller Scholars Program and the UC Berkeley Latinx Research Center's Faculty-Mentored Undergraduate Research Fellowships. Before Berkeley, I studied Sociology & Chicano Studies at San Diego City College, where I was mentored by Marilyn Espitia and Sarah Pitcher.
