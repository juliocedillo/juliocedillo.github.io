I am a sociologist conducting research on the relationship between Latino identity, politics, and military service. I'm currently working on a pilot study titled _Militarizing Latinos: National Identity and Belonging in the United States_ supervised and taught by Dr. Laura J. Enr√≠quez in Sociology 108: Advanced Methods: In-Depth Interviewing.

I'm a fourth-year undergraduate transfer student in the Department of Sociology at the University of California, Berkeley. I am supported by the George A. Miller Scholars Program and the Robert and Colleen Haas Scholars Program. Before Berkeley, I studied Sociology & Chicano Studies at San Diego City College, where I was mentored by Marilyn Espitia and Sarah Pitcher. You can find me in the UC Berkeley Transfer Student Center working with Miller Scholars and helping incoming transfer students.
